<body><h1 id='deadline-extension-notice-for-ccic-2021'>Deadline Extension Notice For CCIC 2021</h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Upon requests from potential participants and in order to provide sufficient time for preliminary submissions in CCIC 2021, the organising committee has decided to extend the deadline of the preliminary round to <strong>15th October 2021</strong> for <strong>generators</strong> and <strong>22nd October 2021</strong> for <strong>judges</strong>. </p>
<p>In addition, please notice that the submission requirements for <strong>judges</strong> have changed after the discussion and consideration of the CCIC Organising Committee:</p>
<ol start='' >
<li>For <strong>judges</strong>, <u><strong>preliminary submission is not compulsory.</strong></u> The judge teams may participate in the final round without preliminary submission. Any valid submission record before the final submission deadline <strong>(6th Nov 2021)</strong> will be considered as completing the registration for this challenge. However, it is strongly recommended for the judge team to participate in the preliminary round, so as to accumulate experience and make possible adjustments for the final submission.</li>
<li>For <strong>generators</strong>, <strong><u>participants are still required to complete both the preliminary submission and final submission.</u></strong> </li>

</ol>
